# ACO_travel_itineraries
## Abstract
This project introduces an innovative approach to solve the **Travel Itinerary Problem (TIP)** by utilizing **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**. Our algorithm dynamically optimizes routes and stay durations, catering to two factor constraints, **budget and time**. It effectively addresses the complexities of travel planning by simulating the decision-making process of ants in nature. The algorithm calculates **optimal paths** and **stay durations** to ensure maximum utilization of available resources. This novel application of ACO demonstrates its potential in solving real-world problems, offering a practical solution for efficient and effective travel planning.
